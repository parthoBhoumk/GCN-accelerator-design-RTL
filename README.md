# GCN-accelerator-design-RTL
This was a project I did on EEE 525 at ASU. I designed a GCN accelerator that reads the feature and weight matrix along with Adjacency matrix (given as coordinate matrix form) and classified the nodes at the end. After RTL I also completed synthesis and created the chip with ASAP7 PDK in Cadence Innovus software..
